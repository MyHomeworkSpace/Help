Hi! We probably broke something! :)

No but seriously, here's a few tips

1. Check [this link](http://status.myhomework.space) to see whether we are down!
2. If it says "this message has been automagically logged", please copy the message and email it to [this address](mailto:hello@myhomework.space).
3. If nothing else, please report it under the bad feedback option

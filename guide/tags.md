The PlanHub Planner comes with several color-coded tags. To use a tag, type it in at the beginning of an event. For example, typing in "Test chapter 3" would give that event the tag of "Test", and color it red. We are working to allow custom tags and color, but for now, a list of the tags is as follows:

* HW
* Read
* Reading
* Project
* Report
* Essay
* Paper
* Test
* Final
* Exam
* Midterm
* ICA
* Lab 
* DocID

The PlanHub Planner comes with several color-coded tags. To use a tag, type it in at the beginning of an event. For example, typing in "Test chapter 3" would give that event the tag of "Test", and color it red. In the future, other parts of PlanHub will be able to use these tags to determine how important it is to work on a long-term project and to prioritize some things over others. We are working to allow custom tags and colors, but for now, a list of the tags is as follows:

* HW
* Read
* Reading
* Project
* Report
* Essay
* Paper
* Test
* Final
* Exam
* Midterm
* ICA
* Lab 
* DocID

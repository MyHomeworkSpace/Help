First of all, calm down, but I am sure that your idea is great! It is very easy to suggest a feature in PlanHub.

1. In PlanHub, click the <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> in the menubar at the top right of the screen.
2. Explain your idea in the text box.
3. If you want us to see an image of your screen immediately before you clicked the <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> button, check off the box under the third bullet point.
4. Press submit!
5. Congrats! Your done!
